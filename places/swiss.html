            <p id="loc-header">Zurich, Switzerland</p>
            <p class="desc"> I stopped by in Switzerland in the same trip that I went to France! I also have family in Zurich,
            so I ended up staying with my uncle and cousins. I stayed here a bit longer than France and my trip was about a week and a half.
            I loved how walkable Switzerland was. There were so many scenic areas that felt straight out of a movie, and there was very little need 
            to drive in general. It felt very peaceful and calm, even in the middle of the city. The public transit, while I never took it, seemed very 
            clean and up-to-date. My family also had a shed in the mountains where they tended to their own garden, which was a very pretty sight to see. 
            I'm hoping to stop by again when I'm abroad in the fall! - Rina
